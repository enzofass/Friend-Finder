# Friend-Finder
FriendFinder
Created during Week 7 of Georgia Tech Full-Stack Web Development Course. The goal was to create a Friend Finder app (essentially a dating app but for friends) using Node and Express servers. The user enters the page that leads to a survey. This full-stack site takes in results from the users' surveys, then compare the answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.
